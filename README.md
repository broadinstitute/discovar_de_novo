DISCOVAR de novo (experimental) is a whole genome shotgun assembler that can generate high quality assemblies from the latest 250 base Illumina PCR-free fragment reads.

DISCOVAR de novo (experimental) is undergoing continuous development. There is no 'offical' release, instead please download the latest source code from our nightly builds. Check back often for updates.
